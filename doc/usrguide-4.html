<p>Tela source files (t-files, filenames ending with ``.t'') consist of
Tela statements separated by semicolons. A function definition is just
one type of statement in Tela, thus you can define as many functions
in one t-file as you wish. This feature sets Tela apart from Matlab,
where each M-file always defines only one function. Functions become
defined in the code generation phase. For this reason the order in
which the functions appear in the t-file is unessential, and a
function call may textually precede its definition. Whether this is
good programming style is up to you. Usually there is no point in
putting function definitions inside other functions; if you do it, the
result is the same as if it were a toplevel definition.</p>
<p>Examples of t-files can be found in /usr/local/lib/tela/t, or
whereever you have installed Tela. It is a bit difficult to give a
simple meaningful example which defines multiple functions. A
comprehensive example is provided by the file ``madala.t'', for
example. It also uses the <b>package</b> mechanism to make it a clean
entity that does not unnecessarily conflict with other packages' name
spaces.</p>
