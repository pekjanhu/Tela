<P>telakka (TeLa Kernel Konstruction Accessory) is a program that
generates new Tela kernels. It is implemented as a shell script. It is
used much as a C compiler. C-tela files (.ct files) written by you can
be compiled and linked into Tela using telakka. For example, if
mystuff.ct contains your own function named myfunction,</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
unix> cat mystuff.ct
[y] = myfunction(x)
/* This does something really stupid */
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "in myfunction, x = " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; "\n";
    y = 3.14;
    Add(y,y,x);
    return 0;    // successful exit to Tela
}
unix> telakka -o mytela mystuff.ct
unix> ./mytela
This tela is a tensor language, Version 0.5g.
Type  ?help  for help.
->Try: docview(), source("demo")
>help myfunction

<P>The executable mytela is a full Tela plus the C-tela functions from
mystuff.ct. The help command finds the C-style comment /* ... */
following the function header automatically. Also name completion will
recognize myfunction. C-tela code is C++ code with one syntactic
extention: the function header is simpler and follows Tela
conventions. There is a preprocessor, named ctpp, which converts
C-tela to ordinary C++ by transforming function headers. Telakka calls
ctpp, the system C++ compiler and the linker automatically as
needed. You can pass other object files, libraries and C compilation
switches to telakka as you need.</P>
<P>On systems that support DLD dynamic linking there is a faster method
to bring your own code in Tela. Just compile the .ct file with telakka
-c to produce an .o file. Then use the link function in Tela to bring
the functions in Tela executable; in this way you don't have to
generate a full new copy of the kernel. The link function does not
exist on systems that do not have DLD.</P>

<P>m2t is Matlab to Tela translator. Usage is as follows:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
       m2t [-h?]                       (give help)
   or: m2t [-sd] &lt;file.m >file.t       (basic usage)
   or: m2t [-FSmsd] [files.m] >file.t  (many files at once)

List of possible command line options:

    -F        Ignore script files (process Functions only)
    -S        Ignore function files (process Scripts only)
    -m        Multi-file mode: generate .t files using .m file basenames
    -s        Silent mode, suppress all warnings
    -d        Suppress matrix division warnings
    -h, -?    Produce this message

Examples:

    m2t -F *.m >funcs.t    Compile all function files into "funcs.t"
    m2t -Sm *.m            Compile all scripts in separate t-files

<P>Many Tela functions can reside in one source file, therefore m2t
by default writes to standard output. If you want to stick to Matlab
convention and use only one function per file, you use the -m flag.</P>
<P>The -F and -S arguments are useful tools for selecting either only
function M-files or script M-files. The default is to process both
types of files.</P>
<P>It is important to realize that m2t is not a full-fledged translator.
You almost always have to edit its input in order to run it suffesfully
in Tela. Despite this shortcoming, many people have found m2t extremely
useful. Particularly, m2t has difficulties in recognizing vectors built
without commas. For example, in Matlab is is legal to write</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
a = [1 2 a+3]
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>instead of </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
a = [1,2,a+3].
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>However, m2t properly recognizes only the second form except in some
trivial cases. Keep this in mind when writing new M-files. The other weak
point is in deciding which symbol is a function and which symbol is a matrix.
In Matlab, both function calls and array references use (..) parentheses.
In Tela array refererence must use [..] brackets. m2t does what is possible
to guess what is function and what is variable, but it sometimes guesses
wrong.</P>
<P>It is also important to realize that m2t can be misused, i.e. it can be
used to translate copyrighted M-files to Tela. This is true with any
translator. You as a user are completely responsible for ensuring that
copyright is not violated when using m2t.</P>
