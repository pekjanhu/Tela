<h1>7 <a name="s7"> Interfacing issues Here we explain the main mechanisms to communicate with other programsand data files from Tela. How to extend Tela by your own C/C++functions has been explained in the previous section.</h1>

<h2>7.1 <A Name="ss7.1"> Matlab interfacing </h2>

<p></p>
<p>There are three principal mechanisms to use Tela together with Matlab.</p>
<p>You can import and export Matlab binary files to and from Tela using
the <b>import</b>, <b>import1</b>, <b>export_matlab</b> commands.  Also
Matlab-readable plain ASCII files can be read by <b>import1</b>.  Even
all your workspace variables can be exported or imported easily in
binary form. That is, Tela has the same functionality as two separate
Matlab processes would have.</p>
<p>It is possible to translate your Matlab scripts and M-files to Tela
language.  A translator program <b>m2t</b> exists for this purpose.
See <b>man m2t</b> for details.</p>
<p>If you have the <b>matlabeng.ct</b> module linked within Tela, you can
call Matlab functions and evaluate strings as Matlab commands at run
time. To enable this, there is function <b>matlab_start</b>, which starts
Matlab in the background and sets up necessary communication links.
This is a good aid in development phase if e.g. some important function
is missing in Tela. You can borrow it from Matlab.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>7.2 <A Name="ss7.2"> HDF interfacing </h2>

<p></p>
<p>Tela's native binary format is the HDF (Hierarchical Data Format from
Univ. Illinois/NCSA) format. HDF files created with the <b>save</b> command
can be read by various programs supporting HDF, for example Spyglass
tool programs and IDL. The <b>import</b> command can also read many other
types of HDF files meaningfully. The function <b>export_RIS8</b> exports
8-bit raster image sets in HDF format.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>7.3 <A Name="ss7.3"> ASCII files </h2>

<p></p>
<p>Generic ASCII files can be read by the <b>import1</b> command.
Multidimensional datasets can also be read by inserting the size
information on the first line in a simple format (see <b>help
import1</b>). ASCII files can be written using the <b>fformat</b> and
<b>fprintf</b> functions.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>7.4 <A Name="ss7.4"> Graphics formats </h2>

<p></p>
<p>The <b>PlotMTV</b> program is responsible for the graphics.  It will
save the image in PostScript file if you click the appropriate
button. In <b>PlotMTV1.4.1t</b> and later you can also save the image as
a GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) file by pressing another
button. When the main PlotMTV window has been divided in several data
windows, pressing the GIF button will include all data windows in the
file. Pressing Shift-G under these circumstances will include only the
current data window. The GIF saving will work properly only if the
whole window is visible on your workstation screen (or in the
virtual screen, i.e. it must be in video-RAM).</p>
