<P>Tela ("Tensor Language") is a numerical computing environment. A summary of its
basic features follows:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
        - The syntax reminds C, coming sometimes close to Pascal
        - Some features have been borrowed from Matlab and other languages
        - Tela supports N-dimensional arrays (currently, N must be less than 5)
        - Arrays can be indexed and manipulated as in Matlab and Fortran-90
        - Six basic numerical data types: integer, real and complex arrays
          and scalars
        - Fast. Also scalar loops are pretty fast.
        - Graphics is currently handled using Kenny Toh's PlotMTV program
        - Uses HDF files as native data format
        - Besides in Tela itself, you can also write new functions using C-Tela,
          which is modified C++. Large parts of Tela has been written in C-Tela.
