CREDITS for Tela                         PJ, Version 1.22, 15.5.1995

NOTE: It is very probable that this list contains omissions.
Contact tela-bugs@fmi.fi if you find anything wrong with this list!

- Pekka Janhunen (tela-suggestions@fmi.fi) wrote the kernel
  and most ct- and t-files in the distribution, as well as
  the documentation.

- Kenny Toh (ktoh@td2cad.intel.com) wrote the PlotMTV program.
  It was slightly modified by PJ (the 1.4.1t and later versions).
  The code that writes GIF files has been borrowed from
  John Bradley's popular XV program.

- Matt Welsh (mdw@sunsite.unc.edu) gave us the Linuxdoc-SGML documentation
  system, which is used extensively in all Tela documentation.
  The system enables one to generate ASCII, HTML and LaTeX files from
  SGML source files. The builtin function SGML documents are created
  automatically from the comment strings of ct-files.

- Alain Coetmeur's (coetmeur@icdc.fr) flex++ and bison++ packages
  are used by Tela. These are C++ versions of the GNU flex and
  bison programs. (Nowadays GNU bison & flex may already contain
  enough C++ support that I could change, but why abandon a well
  working system?)

- National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) from
  Illinois created the Hierarchival Data Format (HDF), which
  is the primary data storage method used in Tela.

- The FFTPACK Fortran library was a long term project; the latest
  version was due to Paul N. Swarztrauber of NCAR (Boulder, Colorado)
  in 1985. The code was translated to C++ and a vectorized version
  was written by PJ in early 1995.

- The LAPACK and BLAS libraries are necessary building blocks
  of Tela. I do not have the information handy to find the persons
  responsible for these, but I guess the list would be too long
  anyway to be included here...

- The GNU project of Free Software Foundation has produced some
  of the tools utilized: The Autoconf program and the Readline library.
  Some math functions also contain ideas that stem from the gcc/g++
  standard libraries.

- The MATLAB system by The Math Works Inc. was of course one
  inspirator of Tela. Some of the functions have similar names
  and in some cases they even function similarly enough so that
  a Matlab-to-Tela (m2t) translator was written.

- Ian Searle wrote RLaB, the source code of which was helpful
  in the beginning phase of Tela construction. Tela does not borrow
  any source code from RLaB, though. I think.

- Ari Viljanen (Ari.Viljanen@fmi.fi) made numerous suggestions.

- Antti Tanskanen (Antti.J.Tanskanen@helsinki.fi) helped create binaries
  for some systems (Alpha, Sun).

- Olaf Amm (Olaf.Amm@fmi.fi) also made valuable suggestions.

- Therese Malliavin (terez@tome.cbs.univ-montp1.fr) was
  helpful in producing the binaries for HPUX.
